## What does the Web Next template do?

This template is oriented to provide a web structure that allows users to manage multi-client web applications for future projects and/or developments.

## Importance of the Web Next template

This template is useful because it allows you to save time by providing a predefined design and structure, which means you don't have to start from scratch. You can use this template and customize it according to your needs. It also allows you to get a professional design as it maintains a visual consistency because it has a consistent and attractive user experience, taking advantage of preset functionalities with features such as ui material, recaptcha integration and advantages such as SSR, among others. Finally, the Web Next template ensures adaptability to different devices as it is designed as a PWA.
